            This piece largely focuses on the feelings of dissociation in the modern age. While dissociation itself is not a new phenomenon within the human psyche i feel as though the effects of technology today have brought about dissociation in people in a different kind of way. With so much of our lives wrapped up an intertwined with the internet and modern technology its becoming harder and harder to discern reality from that that's been altered. We now must constantly question what is real, what we may be reading too much into, what we may not be learning enough about. These pressures from the outside world mixed with the already complicated states of mind that we as humans are prone to have, create an environment in which many don't even really know the real versions of themselves much less the real version of the world around them. Enter, Simulacrum.
